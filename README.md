# linear-equations
Provides a means of solving systems of equations without needing additional Python libraries, such as NumPy. This can be universally applied to other languages.

`main.py` breaks the code down into invidual classes, whereas `combined.py` joins everything into a single Python script. Both are provided for preference only.

NOTE: This is only intended for systems of equations that have 9 or fewer variables. There are definitely faster approaches, but this approach uses Leibniz formula to find the determinant of a matrix.
